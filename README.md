# PRISM
**PR**incipled **I**dentification of **S**tructural **M**otif is a framework for identifying structural motifs in relational data. This is an implementation of the algorithms described in the paper *"Principled and Efficient Motif Finding for Structure Learning in Lifted Graphical Models" by Jonathan Feldstein, Dominic Phillips and Efthymia Tsamoura, AAAI 2023*. It is implemented in C++ and highly parallelized to allow for faster computations.

This README should provide you the necessary understanding to run examples using this library and build upon it further. If you do use this library, please cite accordingly.

## A brief technical overview

In this section, we briefly describe what PRISM can be used for and the underlying technical steps that are used to find structural motifs. For a detailed description and a more fundamental mathematical understanding, please consult *"Principled and Efficient Motif Finding for Structure Learning in Lifted Graphical Models" by Jonathan Feldstein, Dominic Phillips and Efthymia Tsamoura, AAAI 2023*.
